# Pantheon Improvement Ideas

## Visual Narrative
- Layer additional orbit bands to represent emergent sub-agents or working groups.
- Introduce colour-coding for personalities vs. memory shards vs. live events.
- Blend in volumetric fog or god-rays to emphasise focus changes.

## Interaction & UX
- Add presets that map to different AI moods (e.g., analytical, creative, dormant).
- Provide tooltip overlays explaining each layer when hovered or tapped.
- Implement timeline scrubbing to replay event evolutions.

## Data Integration
- Stream real data from agent logs or vector databases to drive particle metadata.
- Allow importing JSON descriptors that define cores, memories, and event relationships.
- Expose a WebSocket endpoint so external systems can push live state changes.

## Performance & Scale
- Introduce adaptive particle counts based on device capabilities.
- Add instanced rendering for event lattice connections at higher densities.
- Benchmark and document recommended settings for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Tooling & Automation
- Create a CLI to generate Pantheon presets from AI configuration files.
- Automate visual snapshots/GIF exports for sharing Pantheon states.
- Wire up CI to publish the experience as a static build or Storybook scene.

## Narrative Audio (Optional)
- Although Pantheon is visual-first, experiment with generative audio cues tied to personality shifts or event spikes.
- Provide toggles to enable/disable audio layers so the core experience stays visually focused.
